# About me
Hi everyone! My name is Allen Xiong, and I’m from Holmen, Wisconsin. I’m the youngest of five siblings, with one sister and four brothers. I really enjoy spending time with friends and family, both in person and online. A bit about me: I love playing games, especially competitive ones, and I like taking lots of photos to preserve memories. I also enjoy dining out and traveling whenever I have the opportunity.

I am 18 years old and currently a first-year student in the IT Data Analytics program, aiming to graduate in the spring of 2027 and transfer to the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse (UWL). I am enthusiastic about starting a career in IT and am actively seeking internships or positions with innovative companies like Kwik Trip or Emplify. I offer strong attention to detail, a natural curiosity for technology, and the ability to quickly learn and adapt to new systems and tools. Growing up with both older and newer technologies has given me a unique perspective, enabling me to bridge traditional and modern tech solutions. I am confident that my dedication, technical skills, and passion for data-driven problem solving will make me a valuable contributor in any IT or data analytics role.

Some of my goals include earning my bachelor’s degree by 2029, securing a stable job in my chosen career, and moving to a new place to start the next chapter of my life.
